# This bash script will help you to use sendmail allowing us to send e-mails from
# the terminal in a friendly way just say destination, subject and body in the command
# arguments. It allows us also to send mail attachments with local files.
#
# I find it interesting when using remotely a server with SSH and I must send a file
# located in it to someone. I wrote this little script to send the file directly to
# the destination.

# Changelog:
# - 20141129: Initial idea of the script and wrote basic functionality
# - 20141206: Code clean up
# - 20141208: Allows us to send many attachments 
# - 20141211: Removed extra \n when no extra headers
# - 20141212: Preview mode and additional sendmail find
# - 20150113: Bug fix (sendmail with no arguments)
# - 20150210: Added SENDMAIL_BASIC_ARGS to call sendmail -t and allow more recipients
# - 20150210: Bug fix separate recipient and non-recipient headers (for some reason some
#             mailers didn't do it right when they are mixed.
# - 20150216: Allow body to be read from stdin

# To do:
#  - Doc and examples !!!
